	<p>When I finished high school, I wanted to be a web designer. In college I discovered that most of my class had the same plans, so I decided to focus on programming instead. The course I was taking offered little in the was of programming instruction, so I bought a book about Flash programming and began reading. From Flash I was able to learn PHP and JavaScript.</p>
