# Tim Uruski, Programmer

Hello! I'm Tim Uruski, a programmer working in Calgary, Alberta, which someone once told me is the Texas of Canada. I've been to Texas and our summers are nicer. They're also shorter, so maybe we just appreciate them more. During those short summers I spend my free time riding bicycles and cooking all sorts of things in the kitchen. In the winter I keep cooking. I also read lots of books.

## SAIT, College, 2001--2003
Before college I wanted to be a designer. When I got there, I learned that everyone else wanted to be a designer too. Instead I took up programming and found my career path. The course was mostly about said design, so I started teaching myself ActionScript. In my second year I used that understanding to learn PHP and interaction between client and server programs.

## Ground Level Design, 2003--2006
Ground Level Design was a small marketing agency for local businesses. I started working there for my college practicum and after graduating I was offered a job as a developer. While there I introduced myself to web standards and continued working with Flash, which I used to build small desktop applications before Adobe Air existed.

## Critical Mass, 2006--2009
In the spring of 2006 I was hired by Critical Mass, the largest marketing firm in Calgary, with international clients and over 200 employees. I worked as a full-time Flash developer on high profile clients like Dell, Rolex and Budweiser. Because I was working exclusively with Flash I was able to explore about more fundamental concepts of programming such as inheritance and composition, refactoring and automated building. When I was promoted to senior developer I was tasked with leading a team of developers. I was also given the wonderful privilege of helping to mentor a developer transitioning from the design department. We became very good friends because of our shared appreciation for beautiful code and bike building.

## Corbis/Veer, 2009--2010
After six years in marketing I was frustrated. The indirect communication from clients, filtered through layers of managers seemed to be getting worse. I wanted something more direct, I wanted to own the work I did. applied for a position on an in-house programming team for design elements company Veer, which had recently been acquired by Corbis. I returned my focus to web development and started experimenting with Ruby, putting a strict ban on Flash programming. Switching from a language I knew inside and out to something I hadn't worked on in almost 5 years was a shock, but resulted in a future-proof career that been tremendously rewarding. I also learned to develop web applications for the iPad.

## Fanhattan, 2010--Present
Not quite a year after starting at Corbis, I was asked by a friend from SAIT if I would be interested in helping him work on a movie database site he had been developing in his spare time. His site had recently been acquired by the company formerly known as Vuze, who were now interested in taking his site and developing it into a multi-device entertainment platform. The chance to work on something that big was impossible to pass up. I feel like I've learned more in the first six months than rest of my career.
